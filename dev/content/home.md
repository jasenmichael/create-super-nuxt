&nbsp; Crannog is known for their adventurous arrangements of traditional music. “Thrash Celtic” at its best, they feature primarily Irish songs and Celtic tunes set to fiddle, concertina, percussion, guitar and vocals. They’ve been known to rock the house and bring a tear to a man with a glass eye. Their tendency is to be stark, potent and poignant. They are famous for surprising their fans with new music.
